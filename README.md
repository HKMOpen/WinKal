I noticed someday when i was working on a windows Phone app that what awesome [Date and Time Picker](http://www.geekchamp.com/articles/wp7-datepicker-and-timepicker-in-depth--api-and-customization) Windows  
Phone has as compared to Android. That time i still had Android 4.0 and 2.3 and neither of these have good date and time pickers.
But now Google has released a very nice DTPickers and Flavien Laurent has made a [library](https://github.com/flavienlaurent/datetimepicker) for it. But i 
wanted to see the Windows DTPicker in Android and here it is.  
    
It can be customized and used with the cool animations of Material Designs to produce a really nice DTPicker UI.
